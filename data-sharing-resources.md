# Abstract

Different stages in the research process require different strategies for efficiently sharing data with collaborators, reviewers, and the 
public. In this presentation, data librarians from the University Libraries' Research Data Services unit will provide an overview of resources available to UNM students, staff, and faculty for secure data sharing among co-investigators, as well as for appropriate and ethical publication of open data assets.

The overall workshop day theme is "from numbers to narratives" and is focused on using data to tell stories.
